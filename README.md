# DateScheduler

**DateScheduler** is an ambitious and dynamic mobile application project built using **.NET MAUI**. This application is designed to help users effectively manage their daily tasks, objectives, and reminders across multiple platforms—Android and iOS. The project is currently in development and represents my most challenging and rewarding endeavor to date.

## 🚀 Features (WIP)

### 🌟 Core Functionality
- **Task Management**: Create, view, and manage custom tasks (although I call them tasks, these elements can be viewed as objectives/reminders). Each task can be assigned to a specific day, complete with details such as status, priority, name and description. Basically it's an app that helps end users manage objectives/tasks throughout the day. The app is mainly being developed, because I love giving myself objectives that need to be completed till the end of the day, but didn't find an app that does these 'reminders' in an appropriate way. Thus this app is being developed to accomodate such criteria.
- **Weekly Overview**: A main page that provides a quick glance at active tasks throughout the week, allowing users to manage their time effectively.
- **Calendar Integration**: A dedicated calendar view where users can navigate through dates and view tasks assigned to specific days. Perfect for planning ahead and reviewing past tasks.

### 🧩 Custom Controls/Views
- **Custom Calendar View**: A tailored calendar interface for a seamless user experience, enabling easy navigation and task management by date.
- **Resizable Panel View**: Interactive panels that users can resize by dragging, offering a flexible and responsive interface.

### ⚙️ Architecture & Best Practices
- **Asynchronous Design**: The app employs asynchronous programming to ensure smooth and responsive UI interactions, even when handling data operations.
- **MVVM Pattern**: Following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, the app is structured to promote separation of concerns, making it maintainable and scalable.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, providing an optimal user experience on both Android and iOS devices.

### 🔗 API Integration
- **User Authentication**: Features a login and registration system that connects to a backend API for secure user authentication and session management.
- **Data Sync**: Synchronize tasks with a remote database via API endpoints, ensuring that data is up-to-date and accessible across devices.

## 📅 Pages Overview (WIP)

- **Main Page**: Displays a weekly overview of active tasks, with options to view and check tasks for each day.
- **Calendar Page**: Allows users to select any date and view tasks associated with that date.
- **Login Page**: Secure login functionality integrated with API.
- **Register Page**: Register a new user account through the API.
- **Add Task Page**: Add new tasks to the calendar, specifying details such as date, status, priority, name, and description.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design (WIP)
- **Intuitive and Interactive**: The UI/UX is designed to be user-friendly, with interactive elements that provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **Custom Animations**: To enhance the overall experience, the application will feature custom animations and transitions that make the app more lively and fun to use.

## 🛠️ Development Status
DateScheduler is still a **work in progress**. As the project evolves, new features will be added, and existing ones will be refined. The current version is focused on laying down the foundational architecture and implementing core features.

## 🌟 Ambitious Goals
This project is my most ambitious undertaking yet, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with **.NET MAUI**, basically making next to full use of the powerfull .NET IDE. It incorporates best practices in software development and leverages the power of the **MVVM** pattern to create a robust, maintainable, and scalable application.

Stay tuned for updates as DateScheduler continues to grow and evolve!

## 📌 Notes
- The application is under active development. Some features and designs are subject to change as the project progresses.
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome as I continue to work on making DateScheduler the *ultimate* task management tool.
